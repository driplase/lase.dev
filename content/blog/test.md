Do you see this? I'm messing around with blog content.

I don't know do I even write blogs, but I just made the link in navbar, I probably have to write even a single blog.

By the way, since this website also has a Japanese translation, I might write blogs in Japanese too.\
Most of my friends are Japanese, and I can't disappoint them.

## So what?
Now I can finally write blogs in my website, and IT'S MARKDOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\
<small><NuxtLink to="https://content.nuxt.com/" target="_blank">`@nuxt/content`</NuxtLink> was a nightmare....</small>

## Testground
<NuxtLink to="/blog">This is a NuxtLink component that navigates to `/blog`</NuxtLink>

HORIZONTAL OVERFLOW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
