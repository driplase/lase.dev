I tried using [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio).

Normally, I can just use VSCode to write blogs like this. But, there is a tool by Nuxt, and I thought it's kinda interesting.

## ✨ The Visual Editor ✨

I've used Notion several months ago. When I first used Nuxt Studio, I felt something similar to that.

You can just select words to apply text styles, add link, anything we can do in Markdown! This is so great especially if you have absolutely no idea how markdown works, how to write markdown, or forgot how to do something like attach links in markdown.

Again, I can just use Markdown to write blogs. But in Nuxt Content website, there is a "Open Visual Editor" button. So I tried.

This tool might be useful when you're making a website, and multiple people write blogs, or when you just can't edit the website files.

## So, you're going to write blogs with Nuxt Studio in the future?

I don't know. I think I'm just going to write blogs with Markdown.

But maybe, I might use it again sometime.

## ...when are you gonna write blogs in japanese?

idk, i'm kinda comfortable with english for most sentences.

maybe i'll write blogs in japanese when i want to use japanese, when i want to write something i can only write in japanese, when i want my friends [(they're mostly japanese)]{.text-gray-400.text-sm} to read my blogs, or when i just need to write in [japanese] .
